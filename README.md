Personal Projects

Coded Metatictactoe Game.

Implemented BFS and DFS Algorithms, Queue and Stack classes, as well as
Graham Scan and Gift Wrap (HullAlgorithms), and Quicksort and Merge Sort Algorithms(sorter)

NOTE: Not all code in non-MetaTictactoe files was written by me, but I wrote the algorithms, classes, and sorts listed above.
